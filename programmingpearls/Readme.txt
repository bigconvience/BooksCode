Code from Programming Pearls

Column 1: Programs for sorting integers 
bitsort.c -- Sort with bit vectors. 
sortints.cpp -- Sort using C++ STL sets. 
qsortints.c -- Sort with C library qsort. 
bitsortgen.c -- Generate random integers for sorting. 

Column 2: Test and time algorithms 
rotate.c -- Three ways to rotate the elements of a vector. 
The next two program are used in a pipeline to compute all anagrams in a dictionary 
sign.c -- Sign each word by its letters in sorted order. 
squash.c -- Put each anagram class on a single line. 

Column 5: Scaffolding for testing and timing search functions 
search.c -- Linear and binary search. 

Column 7: Tiny experiment on C run times 
timemod0.c -- Edit main to time one operation. 

Column 8: Compute the maximum-sum subsequence in an array 
maxsum.c -- Time four algs: n3, n2, n log n, n. 

Column 9: Code tuning programs 
genbins.c -- Profile this, then try a special-purpose allocator. 
macfun.c -- Time the cost of macros and functions. 
The column also uses rotate.c (Column 2), search.c (Column 5) and maxsum.c (Column 8). 

Column 11: Test and time sorting algorithms 
sort.cpp -- Mostly C, but also C++ sort function. 
SortAnim.java -- Animate those sort functions in Java. 

Column 12: Generate a sorted list of random integers 
sortedrand.cpp -- Several algorithms for the task. 

Column 13: Set representations for the problem in Column 12 
sets.cpp -- Several data structures for sets. 
genbins.c (Column 9) implements the bin data structure in C. 

Column 14: Heaps 
priqueue.cpp -- Implement and test priority queues. 
The column also uses sort.c (Column 11) for heapsort. 

Column 15: Strings 
wordlist.cpp -- List words in the file, using STL set. 
wordfreq.cpp -- List words in the file, with counts, using STL map. 
wordfreq.c -- Same as above, with hash table in C. 
longdup.c -- Find long repeated strings in input. 
markov.c -- Generate random text from input. 
markovhash.c -- Like markov.c, but with hashing. 
markovlet.c -- Letter-level markov text, simple algorithm. 

Appendix 3: Cost Models 
spacemod.cpp -- Space used by various records. 
timemod.c -- Table of times used by various C constructs.
